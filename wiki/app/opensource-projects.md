## ACRA

https://github.com/ACRA/acra

ACRA是一个可以让安卓应用自动发出GoogleDoc格式崩溃报告的函数库。安卓开发者可以通过ACRA获取应用崩溃或者错误行为的数据。如果有一个崩溃发生，你的应用不会越过已有的系统崩溃提醒或者报告功能来添加用户提醒。如果使用Toast、状态提醒条或者直接对话框模式，这个“强制关闭”的对话框不会再显示，就算设备上原生系统的提醒功能开启也不能发送一个另外的报告。了解更多

## netty

http://netty.io/

Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.

'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
